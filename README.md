### mini project 1
https://heisdera.github.io/simple_redmi_calculator/

## Summary
At my first trial everything worked just fine except complex calculations that have any 2 of these operators (ร รท %) in a single calculation and it also had tons of if and else statements.
On my second trial I had it fixed by using a function that could replace multiple characters with another multiple character instead of .replace() which I initial used.
